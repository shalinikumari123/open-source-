in this revision i implemented sql and php in my website of idea sharing website.
I created 2 tables one for storing the data of user and another for storing the 
ideas provided by them and connected them by foreign key.so I implemented login 
and sign in fully working state using sql and php.I also implemented the sessions
using php.
I also provided admin rights to select the ideas which will be shown on the page 
eg to create session code 
<?php
 session_start();
?>
eg code for showing the ideas using php
<?php
		  mysql_connect("localhost","learn_php","shalini@123");
			mysql_select_db("login");
			$res=mysql_query("select post,sno,username,email from post where status=2");?>
			
			<?php
			        $c=1;
					 echo"<br>";
					while($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($res)){
                        echo $c;
						 echo ".";
						 echo"IDEA";
						 echo"<br>";
						 echo $row['post'];
						 echo"<br>";
						 echo"USERNAME--";
						 echo $row['username'];
						  echo"<br>";
						  echo "EMAIL-ID--";
						 echo $row['email'];
						  echo"<br>";
						 echo"<br>";
						 echo"<br>";
						 $c++;
